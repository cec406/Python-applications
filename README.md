Two versions of a clean, private, 100% local note-taking/journaling app — no cloud, no account, no tracking.  
Perfect for personal reflections, Bible study notes, business ideas, client recaps, or daily thoughts.

Both tools save everything as plain `.txt` files in the same folder as the script — fully under your control.

- Add notes continuously (type lines, end with `done`)
- View full journal content with word count
- Append summaries (type/paste manually)

- Graceful exit with full file path
