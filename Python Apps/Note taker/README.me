# Grizzly Note Taker

**Simple Offline Journal & Note-Taking App**  
Built by **Grizzly System Engineering** – East Helena, Montana

**Key Features**
- Create any number of named journals (e.g., "Bible Study", "Dune Notes", "Montana Projects")
- Add plain-text notes (no forced timestamps)
- View full journal content anytime
- Manually add summaries (paste AI-generated ones from Grok, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Colorful console interface using Colorama
- 100% offline & private — files stay on your machine

**Why This Tool?**  
No subscriptions, no cloud sync, no bloat. Ideal for users who want reliable, offline note-taking without service dependency.
