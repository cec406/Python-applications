# Harambe Escape

A silly, retro-style pixel-art arcade game made with Pygame.

You play as a pixelated Harambe trying to survive in the zoo. Dodge the children — touching one summons the zookeeper, who then shoots a bullet straight at you. Survive as long as you can... or don't. It's basically inevitable.

A dark-humor tribute to the 2016 Harambe meme, built as a fun coding experiment by Grizzly System Engineering (East Helena, Montana).

## Gameplay

- Move with arrow keys
- Touch a child → zookeeper appears and fires
- Get hit by the bullet → Game Over
- After game over: Press Y to play again, N or Q to quit

## Screenshot Examples

(These are conceptual — run the game yourself to see the real pixel chaos!)

- Pixel Harambe dodging kids
- Zookeeper taking aim
- Bullet flying across the screen
- Classic "Zookeeper Shot Harambe!" screen

## Features

- Hand-crafted pixel art defined entirely in code (no image files needed)
- 8 randomly wandering children
- Simple collision + bullet mechanics
- Game reset / replay prompt
- Low-res retro aesthetic (800×600 window, blocky movement)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame (pip install pygame)

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the folder:
